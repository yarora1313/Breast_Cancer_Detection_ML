This project a comparative study of 2 feature extraction methods Greycoprop and Haralick features which are based on Grey Level Co-Occurance Matrix 
Features were selected from these dataset using Pearson Coefficient 
Performance of these 2 datasets were compared over different Machine Learning Models like SVM, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree,Linear Perceptron
