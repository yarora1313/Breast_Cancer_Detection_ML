This project a comparative study of performance of 2 feature extraction methods Greycoprop and Haralick which are based on Grey Level Co-Occurance Matrix.
Features obtained were selected using Pearson Coefficient value.
Performance metrics of these 2 datasets were compared over different Machine Learning Models like SVM, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree,Linear Perceptron
